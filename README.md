# RiPO
## About
Collaborative academic project aimed at creating software with a configurator for analyzing rear car camera video to detect dangerous situations. The configurator allows users to set car parameters (e.g., width, length) to adjust the backing lines zone displayed over the recording.

For the system to function properly, the camera must be placed in a specific way due to the underlying algorithm that calculates the approximate distance from the detected object. Flask was used for developing the web page with configurator, webcam, and video analysis pages.
